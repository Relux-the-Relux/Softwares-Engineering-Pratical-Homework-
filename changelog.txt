			quote from homework assignment:
			"Erfahrungsgemäß ubersteht es ein Buch nur 50 mal, ausgeliehen zu werden. Anschließend wird das
			Buch aus dem Bestand aussortiert. Damit die Verfugbarkeit von beliebten Büchern dadurch nicht ¨
			allzu stark leidet, genugen bei ausgemusterten Büchern bereits zwei Beschaffungsw ¨ unsche, bis die ¨
			Bibliothek es erneut kauft."
		-returnBook() has been rewritten accordingly
